guile-curl is a project that has procedures that allow Guile to do
client-side URL transfers, like requesting documents from http or ftp
servers.  It is based on the libcurl library.

If trying to build this from the repository instead of a tarball,
you'll need to run 'autoreconf -vi'.  There is a 'bootstrap' script,
but, it is just a call to 'autoreconf'.

This is an autotools build, so usually building is a "./configure &&
make && make install" sort of thing.

For information on how to use it, there is a manual in the doc/
directory.
