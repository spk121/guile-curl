guile-curl is a project that has procedures that allow Guile to do
client-side URL transfers, like requesting documents from http or ftp
servers.  It is based on the libcurl library.

If trying to build this from the repository instead of a tarball,
please run the provided "bootstrap" script which will set up the build
and download the required gnulib subproject.  (This bootstrap script
will run the autotools commands such as automake and autoconf.)

For the boilerplate information on how to install a GNU package
from source, check INSTALL.

For information on how to use it, there is a manual in the doc/ directory.
